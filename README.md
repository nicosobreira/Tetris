# Tetris

## TODO

- [ ] Create menu and interface;
- [ ] Add sound effects;
- [ ] The game velocity need to be increment depending on the score;
- [ ] The score need to be render in the middle of the arena.
- [ ] Remove "floating numbers" in functions, and put then in variables

### EXTRA

- [x] Use `love.graphics.retangle()` instead of `sprites`.

## MAYBE

- Every `Arena` have a `Block` inside, so instead of having the two separate group them **together**.
